# Socialyze - Interactive Visualizations for Social Media

The massive growth of social media has presented the world with both heretofore unknown capabilities, but also massive challenges.
In order to better our understanding of social media's structures (or perhaps lack thereof), Socialyze is a new web-app for people wanting to gain new perspectives and insights into their own social media use, or social media use in general.

Socialyze will be an information visualization webapp where users can create custom visualizations of social network trends, user networks, and other public information.
Users will be able to choose from a selection of websites and datasets to create visualizations in order to better study or portray social media trends and topics.
The site will offer an interactive graphical interface over which the users can select datasets and types of visualizations (bar graphs, diagrams, network graphs).
Modifications to the visualization's settings will be immediately visible to the user.
If possible (and relevant), the visualized datasets will show live updates.
